Building common terminology between MIMSY and Vision
The terms used for tagging Meadâ€™s collection differ from those Vision uses to classify
images. Many Vision terms are semantically the same and can be put under a general
tag. For example, vision terms like bird, blackbird, bluebird, hummingbird, can all be mapped to MIMSY's bird tag.

Vision and MIMSY also have many gender-specific tag terms (e.g., women and
actresses). Since gender expressions differ among cultures and time periods, we
removed all gender-specific Vision tags. The result was a Python dictionary of 1,237
(out of 19,985 total) distinct Google tags mapped to 630 (out of 999 total) MIMSY
tags.

Mead tags use plural nouns and Google Vision API uses singular nouns so we also have to match certain patterns.
After building the dictionary, words were polished by Dr. Miloslava Hruba.
